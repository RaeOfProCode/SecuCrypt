### Description
"SecuCrypt" is a command-line cryptography tool. The tool uses the `rich`, `shutil`, `binascii`, and `Pycryptodome` libraries for enhanced console output and supports various encryption algorithms such as AES, DES, MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256. The main purpose of this tool is to allow users to easily encrypt text using various algorithms, making it useful for educational purposes or basic cryptographic tasks.

### Key Features
- **Title and Description Display:** The tool displays an ASCII art logo and description if the terminal size allows it.
- **Text Conversion:** Functions for converting ASCII strings to hexadecimal and vice versa.
- **Encryption Functions:** Implementations of encryption using AES, DES, and hashing using MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256. The tool prompts the user for input and processes it using the selected encryption algorithm.
- **Main Menu:** A user-friendly menu that allows users to select an encryption algorithm or exit the program. After an operation, the user can return to the main menu or exit.

### Required Python Libraries
- rich
- shutil
- binascii
- Pycryptodome
